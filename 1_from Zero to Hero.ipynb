    "Several types of agents are available in LangChain:  \n",
    "- The `zero-shot-react-description` agent uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to employ based purely on the tool's description. It necessitates a description of each tool.\n",
    "- The `react-docstore` agent engages with a docstore through the ReAct framework. It needs two tools: a Search tool and a Lookup tool. The Search tool finds a document, and the Lookup tool searches for a term in the most recently discovered document.\n",
    "- The `self-ask-with-search` agent employs a single tool named Intermediate Answer, which is capable of looking up factual responses to queries. It is identical to the original self-ask with the search paper, where a Google search API was provided as the tool.\n",
    "- The `conversational-react-description` agent is designed for conversational situations. It uses the ReAct framework to select a tool and uses memory to remember past conversation interactions."
